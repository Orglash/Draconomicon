	<h2>The Dragon's Body</h2>

	<p>At first glance, a true dragon resembles a reptile. It has a
muscular body, a long, thick neck, a horned or frilled
head with a toothy mouth, and a sinuous tail. The creature
walks on four powerful legs with clawed feet, and it
flies using its vast, batlike wings. Heavy scales cover a
dragon from the tip of its tail to end of its snout. As
you’ll see from the details to come, however, that first
glance doesn’t begin to tell the whole story about the
nature of dragons.</p>

	<h3>External anatomy</h3>

	<p>Despite its scales and wings, a dragon’s body has features
that seem more feline than reptilian. Refer to
the illustrations on the next few pages as you read on.
Like a cat’s eye, a dragon’s eye has a comparatively
large iris with a vertical pupil. This arrangement
allows the pupil to open extremely wide and admit
much more light than a human eye can.</p>
