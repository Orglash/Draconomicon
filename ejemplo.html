	<h2>The Dragon's Body</h2>

	<p style="color:gold; font-size:18px; background-color:darkkhaki;">At first glance, a <del>true</del> dragon resembles a reptile. It has a muscular body, a long, thick neck, a horned or frilled head with a toothy mouth, and a sinuous tail. The creature walks on four powerful legs with clawed feet, and it flies using its vast, batlike wings. Heavy scales cover a dragon from the tip of its tail to end of its snout. As you’ll see from the details to come, however, that first glance doesn’t begin to tell the whole story about <mark>the nature of dragons.</mark></p>

	<h3>External anatomy</h3>

	<p>Despite its scales and wings, a <strong>dragon’s body</strong> has features that seem more <em>feline</em> than <i>reptilian</i>. <small>Refer to the illustrations on the next few pages as you read on.</small> Like a cat’s eye, a dragon’s eye has a <ins>comparatively</ins> large iris with a vertical pupil. This arrangement allows the pupil to open extremely wide and admit much more light than a human eye can.</p>
