	<h1>DRACONOMICON: THE BOOK OF DRAGONS</h1>

	<h2>THE DRAGON’S BODY</h2>
	<q class="cita">How can one imagine anything more magnificent than . . . a dragon, the paragon of creation?</q>
	<br>
	<b class="cita">—Bheilorveilthion, red wyrm.</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	<q class="cita">Nothing but a bunch of vain, glorified flying reptiles, if you ask me!</q>
	<br>
	<b class="cita">—Hatredymaes, androsphinx.</b>

	<p>At first glance, a true dragon resembles a reptile. It has a muscular body, a long, thick neck, a horned or frilled head with a toothy mouth, and a
	sinuous tail. The creature walks on four powerful legs with clawed feet, and it flies using its vast, batlike wings. Heavy scales cover a dragon from the tip of its tail to end of
	its snout. <ins>As
	you’ll see from the details to come, however, that first glance doesn’t begin to tell the whole story about the nature of dragons.</ins></p>

	<h3>EXTERNAL ANATOMY</h3>
	<p>Despite its scales and wings, a dragon’s body has features that seem more feline than reptilian. <small>Refer to the illustrations on the next few
	pages as you read on.</small></p>

	<h4>EYES</h4>
	<p>Like a cat’s eye, a dragon’s eye has a comparatively large iris with a vertical pupil. This arrangement allows the pupil to open extremely wide and
	admit much more light than a human eye can. The sclera,	or <i>"white"</i>, of a dragon’s eye is often yellow, gold, green, orange, red, or silver, with an iris of a darker,
	contrasting color. To a	casual observer, a	dragon’s pupils always look like vertical slits. If one were to look very closely into a dragon’s eye, however, one could see a second
	iris and pupil within the first. The dragon can shift and rotate this inner aperture up to 90 degrees, so that the inner pupil can overlay the outer one or lie at a right angle to
	it. This ocular structure gives a dragon extremely accurate depth perception and focusing ability no matter how much or how little light is available. A dragon’s eye is protected by
	a leathery outer eyelid and three smooth inner eyelids, or nictitating membranes. The innermost membrane is crystal clear and serves to protect the eye from damage while the dragon
	flies, fights, swims, or burrows with its eyes open. The other two eyelids mainly serve to keep the inner membrane and the surface of the eye clean. They are thicker than the 
	innermost membrane and less clear. A dragon can use these inner lids to protect its eyes from sudden flashes of bright light. A dragon’s eyes glow in the dark, but the dragon can
	hide the glow by closing one or more of its inner eyelids; doing this does not affect its vision.</p>

	<h4>EARS</h4>
	<p>A dragon’s ears often prove indistinguishable from the frills that frame its head, especially when the dragon is at rest. The ears of an an active
	dragon, however, constantly twitch and swivel as the dragon tracks sounds. Not all dragons have external ears; burrowing and aquatic dragons usually have simple ear holes protected
	by an overhanging fringe.</p>

	<h4>MOUTH</h4>
	<p>A dragon’s mouth features powerful jaws, a forked tongue, and sharp teeth. The exact number and size of a dragon’s teeth depend on the dragon’s 
	age, habitat, and diet; however, a dragon’s array of teeth usually includes four well-developed fangs (two upper, two lower) that curve slightly inward and have cutting edges on both
	the inner and outer surfaces. A dragon uses its fangs to impale and	kill prey, and they serve as the dragon’s primary weapons. Immediately in front of the fangs in each jaw lie the 
	dragon’s incisors, which are oval in cross-section and have serrated edges at the top.	When a dragon bites down on large prey, these teeth cut out a semicircle of flesh. Behind the 
	fangs in each jaw, a dragon has a row of peglike molars that help it grip prey. A dragon is not well equipped for chewing, and it typically tears prey into chunks small enough to 
	gulp down. A dragon can create a sawing motion with its incisors by wiggling its lower jaw and shaking its head from side to side, allowing the incisors to quickly shear through 
	flesh and bone. Many dragons learn to seize prey and literally shake it to death. Other dragons have mastered the technique of grabbing prey and swallowing it whole. Some dragon
	hunters boast that they can hold a dragon’s mouth closed, preventing the creature from biting. It is true that a dragon applies more force when closing its jaws than it does when 
	opening them; however, holding a dragon’s mouth closed still requires prodigious strength. Even if a foe were to succeed in clamping its jaws shut, the dragon is likely to throw off 
	the opponent with one flick of its head, claw its attacker to ribbons, or both.</p>

	<h4>HORNS, SPINES & FRILLS</h4>
	<p>The spines, frills, and other projections that adorn a dragon’s head make the creature look fearsome, and that is their main function. A dragon’s horn is a keratinous projection
	growing directly from the dragon’s skull. A dragon with horns that point backward can use the horns for grooming, and they also help protect the dragon’s upper neck in combat. Horns
	projecting from the sides of a dragon’s head help protect the head. A dragon’s spines are keratinous, but softer and more flexible than its horns. The spines are imbedded in the
	dragon’s skin and anchored to the skeleton by ligaments. Most spines are located along the dragon’s back and tail. Unlike horns, spines are mobile, with a range of motion that varies
	with the kind of dragon and the spines’ location on the dragon’s body. The spines along a dragon’s back, for example, can only be raised or	lowered, whereas the spines supporting a 
	dragon’s ears can be moved many different ways. The frills on a dragon’s back and tail help keep the dragon stable when flying or swimming.</p>

	<h4>LIMBS</h4>
	<p>To a scholar who knows something about the natural world, a dragon’s powerful legs are decidedly nonreptilian, despite their scaly coverings. A dragon’s legs are positioned more
	or less directly under its body, in the manner of mammals. (Most reptiles’ legs tend to splay out to the sides, offering much less support and mobility than a dragon or mammal
	enjoys.) A dragon’s four feet resemble those of a great bird. Each foot has three or four clawed toes facing forward (the number varies, even among dragons	of the same kind), plus an 
	additional toe, also with a claw, set farther back on the foot and facing slightly inward toward the dragon’s body, like a human’s thumb. Although a dragon’s front feet are not truly
	prehensile, a dragon can grasp objects with its front feet, provided they are not too small. This grip is not precise enough for tool use, writing, or wielding a weapon, but a dragon
	can hold and carry objects. A dragon also is capable of wielding magical devices, such as wands, and can complete somatic components required for the spells it can cast <del>(see
	Spellcasting, below)</del>. Some dragons are adroit enough to seize prey in their front claws and carry it aloft. A dragon can use the <i>“thumbs”</i> on its rear feet to grasp as
	well, but the grip is less precise than that of the front feet.</p>

	<h4>SKIN & SCALES</h4>
	<p>A dragon’s skin resembles crocodile hide—tough, leathery, and thick. Unlike a crocodile, however, a dragon has hundreds of hard, durable scales 
	covering its body. A dragon’s scales are keratinous, like its spines. Unlike the spines, however, a dragon’s scales are not attached to its skeleton, and the dragon cannot make them
	move. The scales are much harder and less flexible than the spines, with a resistance to blows that exceeds that of steel. A dragon’s largest scales are attached to its hide along
	one edge and overlap their neighbors like shingles on a roof or the articulated plates in a suit of armor. These scales cover the dragon’s neck, underbelly, toes, and tail. As the
	dragon moves its body, the scales tend to shift as the skin and muscle under them moves, and the scales’ free ends sometimes rise up slightly. This phenomenon has led some observers
	to mistakenly conclude that a dragon can raise and lower its scales in the same manner as a bird fluffing its feathers. The majority of a dragon’s scales are smaller and attached to
	the skin near their centers. These scales interlock with neighboring scales, giving the	surface of the body a pebbly texture. The scales are large enough to form a continuous layer
	of natural armor over the body even when it stretches or bulges to its greatest extent. When the body relaxes or contracts, the skin under the scales tends to fold and wrinkle,
	though the interlocking scales give the body a fairly smooth look. A dragon’s scales grow throughout its lifetime, albeit very slowly. Unlike most other scaled creatures, a dragon
	neither sheds its skin nor sheds individual scales. Instead, its individual scales grow larger, and it also grows new scales as its body gets bigger. Over the years, a scale may
	weather and crack near the edges, but its slow growth usually proves sufficient to replace any portion that breaks off. Dragons occasionally lose scales, especially if they become
	badly damaged. Old scales often litter the floors of long-occupied dragon lairs. When a dragon loses a scale, it usually grows a new one in its place. The new scale tends to be 
	smaller than its neighbors and usually thinner and weaker as well. This phenomenon is what gives rise to bards’ tales about chinks in a dragon’s armor. These tales are true as far as
	they go, but one new scale on a dragon’s massive body seldom leaves the dragon particularly vulnerable to attack.</p>

	<h4>TAIL & WINGS</h4>
	<p>A dragon’s long, muscular tail serves mainly as a rudder in flight. A dragon also uses its tail for propulsion when swimming, and as a weapon. A 
	dragon’s wings consist of a membrane of scaleless hide stretched over a framework of strong but lightweight bones. Immensely powerful muscles in the dragon’s chest provide power for
	flight. Most dragons have wings that resemble bat wings, with a relatively short supporting alar limb, ending in a vestigial claw that juts forward. Most of the wing area comes from
	a membrane stretched over elongated <i>"fingers"</i> of bone <del>(the alar phalanges; see Skeleton, below)</del>, which stretch far beyond the alar limb. Some kinds of dragons have
	wings that run the lengths of their bodies, something like the <i>"wings"</i> of manta rays. This sort of wing also has an alar limb with phalanges supporting the forward third of
	the wing, but the remainder of the wing is supported by modified frill spines that have only a limited range of	motion and muscular	control.</p>
